# Project Todos

Todo-lists can sometimes be stressful, so I wanted to make one with soft colors and clouds. I created this simple todo-list with the help of React-Redux. In it you will find:

- the current date
- total amount of tasks
- input field with submit button
- local storage
- checkbox for completed tasks
- delete button for deleting tasks
- and the date from when the task was created.

## The problem

The task at hand was to make a todo-list which fulfills these requirements:
Your app should list all todo tasks - completed or uncompleted

- You should be able to mark an uncompleted task as complete (and change it back to uncomplete)
- You should be able to add and remove tasks
- Your app should show a count of either all todos, or all uncomplete todos (or both)

I managed to fulfill these requirements with the help of study-partners, online resources and lectures.
